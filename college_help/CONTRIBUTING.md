## üíª Code Style Guidelines

### Flutter & Dart Guidelines

1. **Follow Dart's Official Style Guide**: [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - `UpperCamelCase` for classes, enums, typedefs, and extensions
   - `lowerCamelCase` for variables, methods, and functions
   - `snake_case` for file names

3. **Widget Structure**
   ```dart
   class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
     // Final variables at the top
     final String title;
     
     // Constructor comes next
     const MyWidget({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);
     
     // Build method after that
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       // Method implementation
     }
     
     // Helper methods last
     Widget _buildSection() {
       // Method implementation
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Use const where possible** for better performance

5. **Prefer named parameters** for better code readability

6. **Importing Order**
   ```dart
   // Dart imports
   import 'dart:async';
   
   // Flutter imports
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   
   // Third-party packages
   import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
   
   // App imports
   import 'package:college_help/constants/app_colors.dart';
   ```

7. **Comments**: Use `///` for documentation comments and `//` for implementation comments

### Architecture Guidelines

1. **Follow the established architecture** outlined in the README

2. **Keep UI separate from business logic**

3. **Make components reusable** when possible

4. **Use models** for structured data

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

2. **Run tests locally** before submitting a PR
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

3. **Test on multiple devices/platforms** if possible

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

1. **Document all public APIs, classes, and methods**

2. **Update README** with any new features or changes to installation/usage

3. **Include code examples** for complex features

1. **Use the issue tracker**

2. **Describe the bug in detail**:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Device/environment information

3. **Label issues appropriately**

## üí° Feature Requests
