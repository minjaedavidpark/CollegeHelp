## üíª Code Style Guidelines

### Flutter & Dart Guidelines

1. **Follow Dart's Official Style Guide**: [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - `UpperCamelCase` for classes, enums, typedefs, and extensions
   - `lowerCamelCase` for variables, methods, and functions
   - `snake_case` for file names

3. **Widget Structure**
   ```dart
   class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
     // Final variables at the top
     final String title;
     
     // Constructor comes next
     const MyWidget({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);
     
     // Build method after that
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       // Method implementation
     }
     
     // Helper methods last
     Widget _buildSection() {
       // Method implementation
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Use const where possible** for better performance

5. **Prefer named parameters** for better code readability

6. **Importing Order**
   ```dart
   // Dart imports
   import 'dart:async';
   
   // Flutter imports
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   
   // Third-party packages
   import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
   
   // App imports
   import 'package:college_help/constants/app_colors.dart';
   ```

7. **Comments**: Use `///` for documentation comments and `//` for implementation comments

### Architecture Guidelines

1. **Follow the established architecture** outlined in the README

2. **Keep UI separate from business logic**

3. **Make components reusable** when possible

4. **Use models** for structured data

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

We aim for good test coverage to ensure app stability and maintainability. Please follow these guidelines when adding or modifying tests.

### Test Directory Structure

Tests should reside in the `college_help/test/` directory. The structure within `test/` should mirror the structure of the `college_help/lib/` directory.

Example:
- Code for `lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart` should have tests in `test/screens/auth/login_screen_test.dart`.
- Code for `lib/widgets/custom_button.dart` should have tests in `test/widgets/custom_button_test.dart`.

### Types of Tests

We primarily use **Widget Tests** for testing UI components (screens, widgets). Unit tests can be used for non-UI logic (models, services if they existed).

### Writing Widget Tests

Widget tests verify that a widget's UI looks and behaves as expected.

1.  **Setup**: Import necessary packages (`flutter_test`, `flutter`, your widget's file). Wrap your widget in `MaterialApp` (or `Scaffold` if appropriate) within `tester.pumpWidget()` to provide necessary context (like `Navigator`, `Theme`).
2.  **Find**: Use `find` methods (e.g., `find.text()`, `find.byType()`, `find.byKey()`, `find.byIcon()`, `find.widgetWithText()`, `find.descendant()`) to locate widgets in the tree.
3.  **Interact**: Use `tester` methods (e.g., `tester.tap()`, `tester.enterText()`, `tester.drag()`, `tester.ensureVisible()`) to simulate user interactions.
4.  **Pump**: Use `tester.pump()` or `tester.pumpAndSettle()` after interactions to rebuild the widget tree and process animations/futures.
    *   `pump()`: Advances the clock by one frame (or a specified duration). Use when you need fine-grained control or to avoid timeouts with infinite animations.
    *   `pumpAndSettle()`: Repeatedly calls `pump()` until the frame settles (no more frames scheduled). Useful for waiting for animations or futures to complete, but can time out if animations don't finish (e.g., repeating animations).
5.  **Assert**: Use `expect()` with `Matcher`s (e.g., `findsOneWidget`, `findsNothing`, `isTrue`, `isFalse`) to verify the state of the UI.

### Example Widget Test (Simplified)

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:college_help/screens/welcome_screen.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('WelcomeScreen shows title and login button', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Setup: Pump the widget within MaterialApp
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MaterialApp(home: WelcomeScreen()));

    // Find: Locate widgets
    final titleFinder = find.text('Welcome to New College');
    final loginButtonFinder = find.widgetWithText(ElevatedButton, 'Login');

    // Assert: Verify widgets are present
    expect(titleFinder, findsOneWidget);
    expect(loginButtonFinder, findsOneWidget);

    // Interact: Tap the login button (Example of interaction)
    // await tester.tap(loginButtonFinder);
    // await tester.pumpAndSettle(); // or tester.pump();

    // Assert: Verify outcome of interaction (e.g., navigation)
    // expect(find.byType(LoginScreen), findsOneWidget);
  });
}
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests from the `college_help` directory:

```bash
flutter test
```

Run tests in a specific file:

```bash
flutter test test/screens/auth/login_screen_test.dart
```

### General Guidelines

1.  **Write tests** for all new features or bug fixes.
2.  Ensure tests cover common use cases, edge cases, and validation logic.
3.  Run tests locally **before** submitting a Pull Request to ensure they pass.
4.  Test on multiple devices/platforms if possible, especially for UI-heavy features.

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

1. **Document all public APIs, classes, and methods**

2. **Update README** with any new features or changes to installation/usage

3. **Include code examples** for complex features

## üêû Reporting Bugs

1. **Use the issue tracker**

2. **Describe the bug in detail**:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Device/environment information

3. **Label issues appropriately**

## üí° Feature Requests

1. **First, check existing issues** to avoid duplicates

2. **Be specific about the problem** the feature will solve

3. **Provide examples of use cases**

4. **Suggest implementation details** if possible

## üë©‚Äçüíª For New College Students

2. **Ask questions** in the comments of issues you'd like to work on

3. **Pair program** with experienced contributors when possible

4. **Contribute to documentation** if you're not ready for code contributions
